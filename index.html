        <p>Yahya Sinwar was killed, which is not very shocking considering he was on the front lines fighting for his people against the zionist regime. the idf could have simply notified the world, 'guys, he's dead,' instead of posting a video showing how they killed Sinwar, which appears nothing short of heroic, documenting his glory once and for all. october 2024.</p>
